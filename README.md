# Arduino Hemodialysis Gamified System  

This repository contains the code and resources for an **Arduino-based hemodialysis system** integrated with a gamified user experience and real-time monitoring. The project aims to improve the dialysis experience by providing both engaging entertainment and critical system monitoring features through a connected mobile application.  

### Features:  
#### **Entertainment and Engagement:**  
- **YouTube Integration:** Watch videos during dialysis sessions.  
- **Social Connectivity:** Call friends or family directly from the app.  
- **Spiritual Enrichment:** Listen to the Holy Qura'an.  

#### **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
- **System Parameters:**  
  - Dialysate temperature.  
  - Blood flow rate.  
  - Blood leakage detection.  
- **Alarms:** Immediate notifications for abnormal conditions, ensuring safety.  

### Components:  
- **Hardware:**  
  - Two liquid pumps.  
  - One flow sensor.  
  - One temperature sensor.  
  - One LDR sensor and laser module for blood leakage detection.  
- **Software:**  
  - Mobile app for parameter monitoring, alarm alerts, and interactive entertainment.  
  - Communication protocols for seamless interaction between Arduino and the app (e.g., Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).  

### Goals:  
1. Enhance patient comfort during hemodialysis.  
2. Provide reliable, real-time monitoring of essential system parameters.  
3. Ensure safety through effective alarms and fail-safe design.
